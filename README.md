# raft

A Haskell implementation of the [Raft consensus protocol](http://raftconsensus.github.io/),
deconstructed as a menagerie of cooperating abstractions for communication, storage
and control. A pure protocol description allows local testing and validation of
exactly the code that is run on a production cluster.

## YOW! LambdaJam 2015: Pure Consensus in a World Full of Failure

This implementation was the subject of a talk at YOW! LambdaJam 2015 in Brisbane,
Australia.
